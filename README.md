## Project Description

This project demonstrates manual API testing of RESTful services using CRUD operations 
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) with Postman.

The Restful Booker public API is used to validate core API functionalities such as request handling, 
response verification, authentication, status code validation, and error handling.

The project includes:
- Understanding and validating API contracts
- Manual test cases for CRUD operations
- Authentication using token-based authorization
- Positive and negative test scenarios
- Verification of API responses and status codes
- Postman collection for hands-on execution
- Screenshots as execution evidence

This project is designed to showcase practical API testing skills suitable for 
Manual Tester / QA Engineer roles.
